# hashingAndDocumentation
Assignment: Documenting a Hashing Implementation in Java
Objective:
To enhance students' skills in reading, understanding, and documenting code according to industry standards. The assignment will focus on a provided hashing implementation, where students must analyze the code, understand its purpose, and write comprehensive documentation for it.

Instructions:
Review the Code:
Download and carefully read the provided hashing implementation. Analyze each method, class, and variable to understand their purpose and how they contribute to the overall functionality.

Run both the console main and the main that includes the simple GUI interface using JFrame.  You can use WindowBuilderLinks to an external site. for making GUIs in Eclipse or any WYSISYG, including ChatGPT or NectirAI.  The GUI program allows the user to enter in an id, and show the record associated with that ID.

Write Documentation:
Write clear and concise documentation for the code, following industry standards. The documentation should include:

Class-level documentation: Explain the purpose of each class and its role in the program.
Method-level documentation: Describe the purpose, parameters, and return values of each method. Include details on any exceptions the method might throw.
Inline Comments: Provide comments on complex or non-intuitive code blocks, explaining their purpose within the larger context.
Follow Industry Standards for Java Documentation:
Use standardized conventions as specified in the Oracle documentation guidelines. You may refer to Runestone Academy Comments and ConditionsLinks to an external site. for detailed instructions.  For the Method-level documentation you should write "documentation style comments" that include the description of each method, the precondition, the postcondition and any parameters using @param.

Submit Your Work:
Provide your documentation within the code as comments, and submit the updated file to your github repo.
